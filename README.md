This script generates a Bit Vector for an input hexadecimal string and then Enables/Disables a specific Bit position in the string. 
This script is used to when the 64 bit positions are exhausted for current features and new features need to be added. This can support 
byte aligned & non byte aligned data of 'N' bits since we cannot do bit mask operations on data > 64 bits.
